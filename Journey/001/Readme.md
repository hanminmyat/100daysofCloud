3. Software as a Service(SaaS)
  -provide completed product that is run and managed by the service provider.
  -eg. end-user application

## Deployment Model
1.Cloud
  -fully deployed in cloud
  -all part of the application run in cloud
  -Cloud-based applications can be built on low-level infrastructure pieces or 
  -can use higher level services that provide abstraction from the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of core infrastructure

2.Hybrid
  -a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud

3.On-permises
