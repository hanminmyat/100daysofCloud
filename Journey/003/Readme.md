# Amazon Elastic Search Service

## Introduction
Today I learned Amazon Elastic Search Service from AWS Educate Program. 
 It is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale Elasticsearch clusters in the AWS Cloud
- first  create a domain. An Amazon ES domain is synonymous with an Elasticsearch cluster. 
- Domains are clusters with the settings, instance types, instance counts, and storage resources that you specify. 
- Each instance acts as one Elasticsearch node.
